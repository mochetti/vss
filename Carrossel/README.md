# Carrossel

Automated Very Small Size Soccer personal repo

This project is a different approach to the complete soccer system, this time all-integrated using Processing.

This is the 2019 competition branch.

Everything here was developed among the robot soccer team Carrossel Caipira from UNESP in Bauru, Brazil.
